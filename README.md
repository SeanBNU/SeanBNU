# Hey, I'm Sean 👋  

_Fun fact: AI writes 92% of my code._

- I spend my time building dope projects that I find fun and exciting — lately, lots of AI stuff. (check out https://promptmaster.gg and https://retro.builders) 

- I've worked in both corporate and startup environments, so I know how to scale things up and break things fast.

- Always learning, always experimenting.

- Currently seeking jobs
